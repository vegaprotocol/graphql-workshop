# Vega example/demo code using GraphQL

This is the example code referenced during Vega GraphQL Workshops.

There are two projects here:

- **cli-tool**: a demonstration of how to call the Vega APIs using GraphQL, we live code this :heart:
- **tradestream**: a trade streamer created by @barnabee for the [Testnet launch event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DynJumPTmW0)

Installation instructions can be found in each project folder README.md
